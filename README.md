#Bioinformatics Coursera Specialization
Here is contained code for all the courses in the bioinformatics courses in the coursera specification

The general structure of the project is to have a numbered subfolder per course under src/main/scala, with 1 class per problem.
These classes will each have a main method meant to be invoked from an IDE such as intellij. They will look under 
`inputs/course<n>/<problem name>/input.txt` for the input they expect, and in general simply print their output to the console.
